# Get Started- Responsive Page From Figma Design

## About

This is a responsive site built based off of an expanded version of the design described in the following tutorials by Angela Delise:

- [Figma Design Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYCesPcxpEw)

- [Figma to HTML/CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4Z0E9uEb0o)

- [Responsive Navbar Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIzi9z8mrTk)

While I used the Responsive Navbar tutorial as a starting point, my final implementation was mostly of my own design. The animated hamburger menu icon is based off of Traversy Media's [Pure CSS Hamburger Menu and Overlay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZg6UfS5zYg&t=8s) tutorial, with some adjustments and simplifications in order to reduce overall markup.
